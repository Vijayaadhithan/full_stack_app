# IndianBudgetTracker Project Documentation

This document provides a detailed overview of the IndianBudgetTracker project, including its backend, frontend, database schema, storage mechanisms, and potential for future expansion.

## 1. Project Overview

IndianBudgetTracker is a platform designed to connect service providers and shops with customers in India. It facilitates booking services, purchasing products, managing profiles, and handling payments.

## 2. Setup and Installation

This section guides you through setting up the project environment.

### 2.1. Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or later recommended)
- npm (usually comes with Node.js)
- PostgreSQL (v14 or later recommended)
- Git

### 2.2. PostgreSQL Setup

1.  **Install PostgreSQL:**
    - **macOS (using Homebrew):** `brew install postgresql`
    - **Ubuntu/Debian:** `sudo apt update && sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib`
    - **Windows:** Download the installer from the [official PostgreSQL website](https://www.postgresql.org/download/windows/).
    - Ensure the PostgreSQL server is running after installation.

2.  **Create Database and User:**
    Connect to PostgreSQL using `psql` or a GUI tool (like pgAdmin).

    ```sql
    -- Create a dedicated user (replace 'your_password' with a strong password)
    CREATE USER indianbudget_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';

    -- Create the database
    CREATE DATABASE indianbudget_db OWNER indianbudget_user;

    -- Grant privileges to the user
    GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE indianbudget_db TO indianbudget_user;
    ```

### 2.3. Project Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    cd IndianBudgetTracker
    ```

2.  **Install Dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    - Copy the example environment file (if one exists, e.g., `.env.example`) to `.env`.
    - Update the `.env` file in the `/server` directory with your database credentials:
      ```
      DATABASE_URL="postgresql://indianbudget_user:your_password@localhost:5432/indianbudget_db"
      # Add other necessary variables like SESSION_SECRET, RAZORPAY_KEY_ID, etc.

## 3. Backend

### 2.1. Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Node.js with Express.js
- **Language:** TypeScript
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **ORM:** Drizzle ORM
- **Authentication:** Passport.js (Local Strategy) with express-session
- **File Uploads:** Multer
- **Payments:** Razorpay (Integrated for processing payments, managing vendor payouts, and handling payment splits)
- **Environment Variables:** `dotenv`

### 2.2. Project Structure (`/server`)

- `index.ts`: Main entry point for the server. Sets up Express, CORS, JSON parsing, file uploads (Multer), static file serving, scheduled tasks (booking expiration), Vite integration (for development), and error handling.
- `routes.ts`: Defines all API endpoints. Organizes routes for users, services, bookings, products, orders, reviews, notifications, returns, promotions, payments (including Razorpay integration), and file uploads. It coordinates with various services, including those in the `services/` directory.
- `routes/`: Contains modular route handlers (e.g., `promotions.ts`, `shops.ts`).
- `db.ts`: Configures the PostgreSQL database connection using `postgres` and initializes Drizzle ORM.
- `auth.ts`: Sets up Passport.js for authentication, including local strategy, password hashing (scrypt), session management, and login/register/logout routes.
- `storage.ts`: Acts as a data access layer, abstracting database operations using Drizzle ORM. Contains functions to interact with various tables (users, services, bookings, etc.).
- `vite.ts`: Handles integration with Vite for development mode.
- `ist-utils.ts`: Provides utility functions for handling Indian Standard Time (IST). This includes converting JavaScript dates to IST strings for database storage, getting the current date and time in IST, converting database timestamp strings back to IST Date objects, calculating expiration dates in IST, and converting arrays of dates to IST. These functions are crucial for ensuring consistent date and time handling across server operations, especially for features like booking expirations and logging.
- `pg-storage.ts`: Implements the `IStorage` interface using PostgreSQL as the backend, managed with Drizzle ORM. It handles various data operations such as fetching users by email or Google ID, deleting users and their associated data (services, bookings, products, orders, reviews, notifications), updating product reviews, and processing refunds. It leverages utility functions from `ist-utils.ts` for correct IST date handling in database interactions. It is also used by `connect-pg-simple` for session storage.
- `services/`: Contains business logic services that are used by the routes.
  - `razorpay-route.ts`: Manages Razorpay integration. This includes creating Razorpay linked accounts for vendors, calculating platform fees, and handling payment splits for orders and bookings. It interacts directly with the Razorpay API.

## 6. Storage

- **Database:** PostgreSQL is the primary data store, managed via Drizzle ORM.
- **Session Storage:** User sessions are stored in the PostgreSQL database (`sessions` table). This is managed using `connect-pg-simple` which integrates with Express sessions, and the `PostgresStorage` class (defined in `pg-storage.ts`) provides the underlying store mechanism.
- **File Storage:** Uploaded files (images, etc.) are stored on the server's local filesystem in the `/uploads` directory (configured via Multer in `server/index.ts`).

## 8. Android Expansion Strategy

The existing RESTful API provides a solid foundation for developing a native Android application.

### 8.1. API Consumption

1.  **API Client:** Use a robust networking library like **Retrofit** (recommended) or Volley to handle API requests and responses efficiently. Define interfaces for API endpoints based on the backend routes.
2.  **Data Models:** Create Kotlin/Java data classes (POJOs/POKOs) that mirror the JSON structures returned by the API. Libraries like Gson or Moshi can be used with Retrofit for automatic JSON parsing.
3.  **Authentication:**
    - **Recommendation:** Implement **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** on the backend (`server/auth.ts`) as a more standard approach for mobile APIs compared to session cookies. The flow would be:
      - App sends credentials to `POST /api/login`.
      - Server validates and returns a JWT.
      - App securely stores the JWT (e.g., using Android's EncryptedSharedPreferences).
      - App includes the JWT in the `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header for subsequent requests.
      - Implement token refresh logic.
    - **Alternative (Session Cookies):** If sticking with sessions, the app needs to manage the session cookie received from the login response and include it in all subsequent requests. This can be more complex to manage securely on mobile.
4.  **API Stability & Versioning:** Ensure backend APIs are stable. Introduce API versioning (e.g., `/api/v1/...`) in `server/routes.ts` to allow backend evolution without breaking the mobile app.

### 8.2. Native Implementation (Kotlin/Java)

1.  **Language:** **Kotlin** is the preferred language for modern Android development due to its conciseness and safety features. Java is also an option.
2.  **Architecture:** Adopt a standard Android architecture pattern like **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel)** or MVI (Model-View-Intent) using Android Jetpack components (ViewModel, LiveData/StateFlow, Room for local caching if needed).
3.  **UI Development:**
    - **Jetpack Compose:** Recommended for building modern, declarative UIs in Kotlin. It allows for faster development and easier maintenance compared to the traditional XML-based view system.
    - **XML Layouts:** Still a viable option, especially if integrating with existing XML-based codebases.
4.  **Key Feature Implementation:**
    - Replicate core user flows (authentication, browsing, booking, ordering, profile management) using native UI components.
    - Utilize the API client (Retrofit) to fetch and send data to the backend.
    - Integrate **Razorpay's Android SDK** for handling payments, coordinating with the backend verification endpoints (`/api/bookings/payment/verify`, etc.).
    - Implement background tasks for data synchronization or offline support if necessary.
5.  **Push Notifications:**
    - Integrate **Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM)** into the Android app.
    - Modify the backend to send push notifications via FCM upon relevant events (e.g., new booking, order status change) by interacting with the FCM API, potentially triggered from within the existing notification logic.

### 8.3. Design Consistency

- **Adapt, Don't Just Copy:** While aiming for a consistent brand feel, directly replicating the web UI (shadcn/ui, Tailwind) on Android is often not ideal. Native Android apps have different navigation patterns and UI conventions.
- **Material Design:** Leverage **Material Design 3** components and guidelines, which provide a robust system for building high-quality Android UIs. Adapt Material components to match the project's color scheme, typography, and overall brand identity.
- **Component Mapping:** Identify core UI elements from the web (Cards, Buttons, Forms, Dialogs, Calendar) and find their closest equivalents in Material Design or build custom Compose components that mimic the _style_ and _functionality_ but adhere to Android best practices.
- **Navigation:** Use Android Jetpack's Navigation component for handling screen transitions and back stack management, following standard Android patterns (e.g., bottom navigation bars, drawers).
- **Responsiveness:** Design layouts that adapt to different screen sizes and orientations on Android devices.

By combining the existing API with native Android development best practices and adapting the design thoughtfully, a high-quality and consistent mobile experience can be achieved.

## 9. Database Backup and Restore

Nightly backups of the PostgreSQL database are scheduled by `scripts/provision.sh`. A cron job runs `pg_dump` at 03:00 UTC and
uploads the compressed dump to the object storage bucket specified by the `BACKUP_BUCKET` environment variable.

### Restoring from a Backup

1. Download the desired dump from object storage.
2. Decompress and feed the output into `psql`.

```bash
aws s3 cp s3://<bucket>/db-2024-01-15.sql.gz - | gunzip | psql "$DATABASE_URL"
```

The command recreates the database state captured at the time of the dump.
